# cookyplan

cookyplan is a mealplan app with option to create your personal recipe collection

#

## Description

cookyplan is my final project (capstone-project) of my 3-month web development bootcamp at neuefische. 

My app is designed to alleviate your daily struggle on deciding what to eat by providing an easy to use mealplan and a collection of all your favorite recipes - all in one place.

The app can be used on desktop and mobile devices. As of now it is most suitable for iPhones 6/7/8.

#
